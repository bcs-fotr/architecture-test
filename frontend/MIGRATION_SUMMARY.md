# UI Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the improved Apple-style UI from `App.js` to the Next.js application structure (`page.tsx`).

## Changes Made

### 1. Main Page Component (`src/app/page.tsx`)

#### UI Enhancements
- **Apple-style Theme**: Updated MUI theme with modern iOS/macOS-inspired colors and typography
  - Primary color: `#3B82F6` (Blue-500)
  - Secondary color: `#8B5CF6` (Purple-500)
  - System font stack: `system-ui, -apple-system, "SF Pro Display"`
  - HSL color system for better consistency

- **Redesigned Sidebar**:
  - Width reduced to 320px for better proportions
  - Gradient background with blur effect
  - Smooth animations using cubic-bezier transitions
  - Editable trip title (click to edit)
  - Close button integrated into sidebar edge
  - Custom toggle button when sidebar is closed

- **Day-based Activity Grouping**:
  - Activities grouped by date using MUI Accordions
  - Sorted chronologically
  - Clean, minimal design with subtle borders and shadows
  - Activities display time and have delete buttons
  - Visual indicator (blue dot) for selected items

- **Add Activity Dialog**:
  - Full-featured form with autocomplete for addresses and activities
  - Address suggestions with fallback data
  - Google Places API integration
  - Activity type selector
  - Date and time pickers
  - Duration and rating inputs
  - Coordinates handling

#### New State Variables
- `addDialogOpen`: Controls add activity dialog visibility
- `newActivity`: Form state for new activity
- `addressSuggestions`: Autocomplete options for addresses
- `activitySuggestions`: Autocomplete options for activities
- `isEditingTitle`: Controls title editing mode
- `editedTripTitle`: Temporary state for edited title

#### New Helper Functions
- `getActivitiesByDay()`: Groups itinerary items by date
- `getActivitySuggestions()`: Returns activity suggestions based on type
- `handleAddressChange()`: Manages address autocomplete
- `handleAddressSelect()`: Handles address selection and geocoding
- `handleActivityChange()`: Manages activity autocomplete
- `removeActivity()`: Deletes activity from backend and updates state
- `addActivity()`: Creates new activity via API
- `handleTitleClick()`: Initiates title editing
- `handleTitleChange()`: Updates title input
- `handleTitleSubmit()`: Saves title via API
- `handleTitleKeyPress()`: Handles Enter/Escape keys during editing

### 2. API Routes

#### Created: `/api/itinerary/[id]/route.ts`
- **DELETE**: Remove individual itinerary items
  - Verifies user ownership
  - Cascades deletion properly
  - Returns success status

- **PUT**: Update individual itinerary items
  - Supports partial updates
  - Validates user permissions
  - Updates all fields including coordinates

#### Created: `/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`
- **PUT**: Update trip details (especially title)
  - Supports partial updates
  - Validates user ownership
  - Updates any trip field

- **DELETE**: Remove trips
  - Verifies user ownership
  - Should cascade delete itinerary items (depending on DB constraints)
